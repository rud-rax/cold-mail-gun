Subject: Python Developer Application - [Your Name]

Dear Apple Hiring Team,

My name is Rudraksh Naik, and I am writing to express my strong interest in the Python Developer position at Apple, which I discovered on your careers page. My background in developing scalable, cloud-native applications and my passion for leveraging AI/ML technologies align perfectly with the requirements of this role. I am particularly drawn to Apple's commitment to innovation and excellence, and I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your team.

During my Software Development Engineer internship at Amazon, I engineered a PLC software component for Orkes Conductor Engine and built an automated CDK pipeline using AWS CloudFormation libraries. Furthermore, as a Backend Developer Intern and AI Researcher at Skilljourney, I integrated OpenAI LLM models into backend applications using Azure Functions. I also tuned LLM parameters, which improved response generation by 10%, and researched models like GPT-4 and Gemini, improving accuracy by 30%. These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in both backend development and advanced AI/ML applications, directly matching the skills outlined in your job description.

In addition to my professional experience, my academic and personal projects demonstrate a deep expertise in this field. My project on "Robust Human Target Detection and Acquisition," which utilized Python and Django for a real-time threat detection web application, showcases my ability to build and deploy full-stack solutions. Furthermore, I have authored two peer-reviewed research papers in the fields of deep learning and computer vision, highlighting my passion for continuous learning and my dedication to the field of computer science.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity further.

Sincerely,

Rudraksh Naik
